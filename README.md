*Overview of Intrusion Detection Techniques*

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):

Network-based IDS (NIDS): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
Host-based IDS (HIDS): Monitors individual hosts or devices for suspicious activity.

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):
An extension of IDS that not only detects but also prevents or blocks detected threats.

Anomaly-based Detection:
Identifies deviations from normal behavior to detect potential intrusions.
Uses statistical methods, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Signature-based Detection:
Relies on predefined patterns or signatures of known threats.
Effective for known threats but less effective for novel or zero-day attacks.

Hybrid Detection:
Combines anomaly-based and signature-based methods for more comprehensive detection.
